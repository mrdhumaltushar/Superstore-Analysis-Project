## 1. Project Objective

This project uses Python to analyze the "Superstore" dataset. It performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and automatically generates a business-ready, multi-chart dashboard in Microsoft Excel.

## 2. Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas:** For data loading, cleaning, and analysis.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating exploratory data visualizations.
* **XlsxWriter:** For building the final Excel dashboard, including dynamic charts and formatted KPIs.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** For developing and presenting the analysis.

## 3. Key Features

* **Data Cleaning:** The script automatically checks for and removes duplicate rows.
* **KPI Calculations:** Generates key metrics like Total Sales, Total Profit, and Overall Profit Margin.
* **Automated Visualizations:** Creates and saves multiple plots:
    * Sales by Region
    * Profit by Category
    * Profit vs. Discount
    * Monthly Sales Trends
* **Excel Dashboard Generation:** Builds a `Superstore_Dashboard.xlsx` file from scratch, embedding the charts and KPIs into a clean, formatted dashboard.
